EWB is a member-run organisation, with support from our Australian-wide network of chapters. We work with disadvantaged communities to improve their quality of life through education and the implementation of sustainable engineering projects, and raise awareness in the community through education and outreach events.\n\nIn Australia a large focus is to provide students from high schools and primary schools with exposure to engineering. University students are a great way of giving high school students this exposure because of recently being in their situation and also because we do engineering! We offer schools four main modules which all have a presentation followed by a focused activity. These four modules explore a large range of engineering disciplines such as Civil Engineering, Bio-medical Engineering, Renewable Energy Engineering and much more! As a university student you will be part of the organisation and running of these workshops. As well as this, the workshops are very hands on and require presentation skills and these skills are not just related to engineering, so anyone (not just engineers) are welcome to join!\n\nAlongside these workshops we have our biggest event, a week-long, all expenses paid for trip around regional NSW that we have neatly named Regioneering. At Regioneering we present the school workshops (mentioned above) but to a large variety of schools (over 50 in some trips!) going as far as places such as Dubbo, Bathurst, Newcastle and Port Maquarie! This trip generally happens in the breaks between of each semester (so one in winter and one in summer) and are both once in a lifetime opportunities. \n\nEngineers without Borders also offers opportunities throughout the year to visit a second/third world country to help out the rural communities that live there. When at the rural community you will help them build a solution to one of their everyday problems, whilst also experiencing their culture and background and is also definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity. \n\nAs well as if this, if you want to be involved in a fun, friendly group of people being involved in picnics, speaker nights (Design Summit info and Pathways to Humanitarian), movie nights, hikes, study tours (of various sustainable systems whether it be water, electricity, etc), BBQs , EWB Games (social sporting comp), bake sales, and inter-university interaction then definitely have a look at our club stall at O-Week and join!", "fees": {"arc": 0, "non-arc": 0, "associate": 0}, "icon_url": "https://cdn.linkupevents.com.au/society/ewbunswchapter.jpg", "categories": ["Engineering & Technology", "Charity"], "keywords": ["Humanitarian", "sustainability", "engineering", "global"], "socials": {"email": "unsw@ewb.org.au", "website": "http://www.ewb.org.au/explore/chapters/nsw/unsw", "facebook_page": "https://www.facebook.com/ewbunswchapter"}, "tags": [], "type": "ARC Club", "linkup_id": "ewbunswchapter"}}, {"is_success": true, "club": {"objectID": "0016F0000371VxR", "club_id": "0016F0000371VxR", "club_name": "Enrich Mandarin Bible Study", "club_shorthand": "EMBS", "clean_id": "enrich_mandarin_bible_study", "description": "We gather together regularly to study the Bible and share our daily life experience.", "fees": {"arc": 0, "non-arc": 0, "associate": 0}, "icon_url": "https://cdn.linkupevents.com.au/arc_logo.png", "categories": ["Religious/Spiritual", "International/Cultural"], "keywords": ["Christian", "Bilble", "Mandarin", "God"], "socials": {"email": "unsw.embs@gmail.com", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/unsw.embs/", "facebook_page": "https://www.facebook.com/unsw.embs/"}, "tags": [], "type": "ARC Club"}}, {"is_success": true, "club": {"objectID": "0016F00003nWFah", "club_id": "0016F00003nWFah", "club_name": "Entrepreneurs' Society", "club_shorthand": "EntSoc", "clean_id": "entrepreneurs'_society", "description": "The UNSW Entrepreneurs' Society is a society that aims to engage UNSW's very own entrepreneurs to learn and grow together.

Whether you are looking for social events, academic help, or career information, we've got you covered! Collaborating with other UNSW societies, as well as in-university and external organisations, we ensure that every psychology student will have the most enriching university experience here.\n\nPsychSoc's foundations stand upon six portfolios which innovate, organise and facilitate PsychSoc's events - Academic, Social, Relations, the Year Representatives, Wellbeing and Marketing and Media.\n\nThe Academic team assists with improving the academic lifestyle and understanding of Psychology students through coding, writing, and exam workshops; whereas the Social team looks to run fun-filled events, forgetting about the stresses of university studies. The Relations portfolio helps students take the first step into connecting with the professional workplace, opening opportunities for you to talk to employers and understand what they look for in a psychology graduate. The Year Representatives bridge PsychSoc with the wider year cohorts, listening to issues, a voice to the student body, and strives to create events that introduces students to new friends in their year group. Sports and Philanthropy is all about building a student culture that remembers to share a bit of love; whether it's self-care, caring for the community or just taking the time to look after one's mental or physical health. All the events PsychSoc pulls together are only made possible by students attending them, and the Marketing and Media team shapes the event pages and marketing material for our events to ensure everyone knows what the society is up to next.\n\nThe Academic Portfolio assists Psychology students with their course work, providing a range of academic resources such as workshops and Psychology core practice exams. The Social portfolio unites the Psychology student body and facilitates long-lasting bonds within a tight-knit society through inclusive, accessible and lively social events. The Relations portfolio helps students take the first step into connecting with the professional workplace, opening opportunities for you to talk to employers and understand what they look for in a psychology graduate. The Wellbeing Portfolio promotes events that are related to philanthropy and mental health with an overarching goal to improve individual wellbeing in the Psychology community. The Year Representatives are the bridge between the PsychSoc committee and the broader Psychology cohort, facilitating student engagement within each year group and being an open and accessible line of communication for students. All the events by PsychSoc are only made possible by students attending them, with the Marketing and Media team promoting events via a variety of engaging media to ensure everyone knows what the society is up to next!\n\nOverseeing all the portfolios is our executive team: the President, Vice-President Operations, the Secretary, the Arc Delegate, the Treasurer, and the Vice-President Internal. When you ask PsychSoc any questions, give us feedback or even just start a chat with us over email or Facebook, our Secretary is the one who replies. The Secretary is our go-to member and will know nearly everything and anything about our society. Our Arc Delegate keeps PsychSoc aligned with Arc, which is a student-run body that ensures all societies and clubs continue to provide services that cater to the students. The Treasurer budgets our spending so we can continue to run our events and will be the one to confirm that your payment has come through to our PsychSoc bank account. The Vice-President Internal facilitates the internal aspect of the committee, overseeing conflict resolution and bonding, and ensuring the committee members are meshing well together. The President and Vice-President work together to lead the committee, drawing from the four characteristics that stimulate the society to always work diligently to create a better UNSW.\n\nWe are excited to welcome you to join our Psychology community!
