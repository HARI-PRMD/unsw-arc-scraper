It will ultimately work towards change that allows animals to live according to their own natural and unique interests, and in turn promote a more harmonious approach to human and non-human interaction. We invites students to share knowledge, investigate and question the treatment of animals in their everyday life. The power of knowledge and information sharing is liberation and education is the premise of progress and change and nowhere is this more well-place than at a university where knowledge sharing is a fundamental ingredient in its core function. We aim to make a valuable educational contribution to the UNSW staff and student community by creating a forum to actively engage, investigate, debate, hypothesise and ultimately raise awareness with regard to the ethical issues and concerns pertaining to animal welfare. We encourage our members to become a voice for animals and through this foster selflessness as they sacrifice your own time to work towards justice for others.","Arc Member Fee":0,"Non Arc Member Fee":0,"Associate Member Fee":0,"New Club":false,"Website":null,"Club Email":"animalvoicesunsw@gmail.com","Facebook Page":"https://www.facebook.com/animalvoicesunsw","Facebook Group":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/animalvoicesunsw/","Discord Server Link":null,"Eligible for AHEGS":false,"Keyword Field":["Animals","Lewis Hamilton","cats","chickens","compassion","cupcake challenge","dogs","environment","fairness","fitness","free BBQ","game changers","health","horses","justice","kangaroo","love","peace","pets","pigs","sheep","vegan"],"Instagram URL":null,"Logo URL":"https://cdn.linkupevents.com.au/society/animalvoicesunsw.jpg","Categories":["Charity"]},"clubGuide":null},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/club/[clubName]","query":{"clubName":"Animal Voices"},"buildId":"ikymQExRFCBliolr4L5Xg","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]},{"props":{"pageProps":{"clubDetails":{"Account Record Type":"Club","Internal Category":null,"Account ID":"0016F0000371Vw1","Account Name":"AnimeUNSW","Short Name":"AnimeUNSW","Description":"Welcome Anime Lovers to AnimeUNSW!

And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. Matthew 28:19-20 Statement of Faith: As a Chinese Christian fellowship, we are called to be committed to evangelism to the Chinese community at UNSW. We rejoice in our fellowship with brothers and sisters from local churches across Sydney, and pray that God will make us a humble, vigorous, attractive fellowship, bringing the good news especially to those who have never heard of Jesus Christ. In light of our nature as a Christian fellowship with members from different church backgrounds and for the sake of clarity and integrity in all our work and relationships, we humbly declare the following fundamental truths of the Christian faith and mission: 1. We believe in the one, holy, sovereign, creating and redeeming God, eternally existing in three Persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 2. We believe in the divine inspiration and entire trustworthiness of the Bible, its infallible teaching and supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct; and its normative value for all peoples, at all times, in all cultures. We believe that all people without distinction are made in the image of God, but all are now sinners and have incurred both God?s holy wrath and their own shame and guilt. All are therefore in utter need of redemption. 3. We believe in Jesus Christ our Lord, the incarnate Son of God, uniquely God-man and the only Savior. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, sacrificial death, bodily resurrection and ascension. We believe He has achieved the final defeat of Satan and all evil powers. 4. We believe in the justification of sinners by God?s grace, through faith in Christ alone. 5. We believe in the Holy Spirit and His convicting, regenerating, sanctifying and reviving work. He guides and empowers individuals and churches in their service to God and all people. 6. We believe in the unity and priesthood of all believers who together form the one, holy, universal, apostolic church. 7. We believe in the visible, personal return of Jesus Christ in power and great glory to judge both the living and the dead. We believe that the Scriptures set out only two destinies for humanity; the joyful prospect of eternal life in the presence of God for those who have received Christ and the agonizing prospect of eternal separation from God for those who have rejected Him.","Arc Member Fee":null,"Non Arc Member Fee":null,"Associate Member Fee":null,"New Club":false,"Website":null,"Club Email":"unswccf@gmail.com","Facebook Page":"https://www.facebook.com/unsw.ccf","Facebook Group":null,"Discord Server Link":null,"Eligible for AHEGS":false,"Keyword Field":["CCF","Chinese","Christian","Fellowship"],"Instagram URL":null,"Logo URL":"https://cdn.linkupevents.com.au/society/unsw.ccf.jpg","Categories":["Religious/Spiritual"]},"clubGuide":null},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/club/[clubName]","query":{"clubName":"Cantonese Christian Fellowship"},"buildId":"ikymQExRFCBliolr4L5Xg","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]},{"props":{"pageProps":{"clubDetails":{"Account Record Type":"Club","Internal Category":null,"Account ID":"0016F0000371VwZ","Account Name":"Car Society","Short Name":"CarSoc","Description":"To most people, cars are a means of getting from A to B, but to us cars are a passion and a lifestyle.

Do we know our own dynamic potential and the power of our own ability? Do we know how to channel our minds towards achieving great success? Do we know why we sometimes feel so angry, frightened, or sad? Do we know how we can be happy and peaceful at all times? CHYK is a meeting place for young minds seeking a greater awareness and understanding of themselves and the world around them. By questions, reflection, and discussion, we seek to empower ourselves and our lives. The wealth hidden in our religion and culture help us grow beyond our limitations, so that we can face the challenges of life with purpose, confidence, and inspiration. Chyks are not those who are not content to sit back and watch, but we want to make a difference in the world, through right thinking and right actions. Chinmaya Mission is a global spiritual organisation that was founded in 1953 by devotees of Swami Chinmayananda in India.

The core aim of CREATE is to provide opportunities for students to learn practical skills in engineering, innovation and design as well as collaborate on shared ideas and projects. By maintaining an active community of like-minded ?makers? and providing resources, knowledge and technology, the club seeks to foster an environment where anyone, regardless of their background, can be inspired to turn their ideas into designs, prototypes and products. We are firm believers in collective knowledge, learning and cooperation as an effective way to expand what is possible for any individual to accomplish. CREATE runs an array of varying activities to help facilitate this ideal. The team hosts a series of workshops teaching basic technical skills in Arduino electrical interfacing and programming as well as Computer Aided Design (CAD) modelling with digital fabrication. CREATE also fosters team projects including: Project Illuminate making annual entries into the VIVID Sydney Light Festival and participating teams in the Droid Racing Challenge (DRC) hosted by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Lastly, they operate the sales of affordable electrical and robotic components at UNSW during semester, to supply students with the parts they need for projects big or small. CREATE has gained many accomplishments over the years, and strives to continue expanding their community and carry forth the maker movement of UNSW.

The 3 main projects that the DRU team are currently working on include: - Solar-Powered UV-C water purification systems for rainwater tanks. The team is currently working in partnership with UNSW Professors and Gulu University to test different prototypes to achieve the most sustainable and efficient system. Targeted SDG?s = 3.

At PsychSoc, we are united by one core mission: to foster a sense of connectedness and community, benefiting our students by supporting their endeavours and providing opportunities to explore, enhance and work towards their goals during their University journey. We want to help you get the most out of your time in psychology, and hence aim to provide events throughout the year for the psychology student community here. Whether you are looking for social events, academic help, or career information, we?ve got you covered! Collaborating with other UNSW societies, as well as in-university and external organisations, we ensure that every psychology student will have the most enriching university experience here. PsychSoc's foundations stand upon six portfolios which innovate, organise and facilitate PsychSoc's events - Academic, Social, Relations, the Year Representatives, Wellbeing and Marketing and Media. The Academic team assists with improving the academic lifestyle and understanding of Psychology students through coding, writing, and exam workshops; whereas the Social team looks to run fun-filled events, forgetting about the stresses of university studies. The Relations portfolio helps students take the first step into connecting with the professional workplace, opening opportunities for you to talk to employers and understand what they look for in a psychology graduate. The Year Representatives bridge PsychSoc with the wider year cohorts, listening to issues, a voice to the student body, and strives to create events that introduces students to new friends in their year group. Sports and Philanthropy is all about building a student culture that remembers to share a bit of love; whether it's self-care, caring for the community or just taking the time to look after one's mental or physical health. All the events PsychSoc pulls together are only made possible by students attending them, and the Marketing and Media team shapes the event pages and marketing material for our events to ensure everyone knows what the society is up to next. The Academic Portfolio assists Psychology students with their course work, providing a range of academic resources such as workshops and Psychology core practice exams. The Social portfolio unites the Psychology student body and facilitates long-lasting bonds within a tight-knit society through inclusive, accessible and lively social events. The Relations portfolio helps students take the first step into connecting with the professional workplace, opening opportunities for you to talk to employers and understand what they look for in a psychology graduate. The Wellbeing Portfolio promotes events that are related to philanthropy and mental health with an overarching goal to improve individual wellbeing in the Psychology community. The Year Representatives are the bridge between the PsychSoc committee and the broader Psychology cohort, facilitating student engagement within each year group and being an open and accessible line of communication for students. All the events by PsychSoc are only made possible by students attending them, with the Marketing and Media team promoting events via a variety of engaging media to ensure everyone knows what the society is up to next! Overseeing all the portfolios is our executive team: the President, Vice-President Operations, the Secretary, the Arc Delegate, the Treasurer, and the Vice-President Internal. When you ask PsychSoc any questions, give us feedback or even just start a chat with us over email or Facebook, our Secretary is the one who replies. The Secretary is our go-to member and will know nearly everything and anything about our society. Our Arc Delegate keeps PsychSoc aligned with Arc, which is a student-run body that ensures all societies and clubs continue to provide services that cater to the students. The Treasurer budgets our spending so we can continue to run our events and will be the one to confirm that your payment has come through to our PsychSoc bank account. The Vice-President Internal facilitates the internal aspect of the committee, overseeing conflict resolution and bonding, and ensuring the committee members are meshing well together. The President and Vice-President work together to lead the committee, drawing from the four characteristics that stimulate the society to always work diligently to create a better UNSW. We are excited to welcome you to join our Psychology community! To keep up to date with all our events and initiatives throughout the year, make sure to do the following: 1. Join us on SpArc 2.

We take pride in the team's commitment to the pursuit of both engineering and business excellence fulfilling our mission to equip students with knowledge and skills from beyond the classroom.\\n\\n \\nOur core values are personal growth, team spirit, challenge, and commitment. We promote a culture of inclusiveness to learn and grow together. The project often requires members to work under high pressure, accelerating the development of critical problem-solving abilities. Redback participates   in   two competitions annually, Formula SAE-A and FS-Sydney. FSAE-A allows students the opportunity to enhance their engineering design and project management skills. It prepares students for a career in various industries and provides the opportunity to network on a global scale. FS-Sydney is another highly rewarding experience for several students across Australia.  \\n\\n \\n\\nStudents have the opportunity to choose between two branches: Technical \\u0026 Business. The Technical team oversees the design, manufacturing, and testing of the car. The Business team upholds the operations, finances, and branding of the team.

In 2022 we had our inaugural event, the Midnights Album Release Party, followed shortly by our final event of the year at Coogee Beach, where we made Taylor-themed friendship bracelets. Taylor Swift has gone through many eras throughout her career, thus dividing her fans on which one is arguably the best. For one of our first events of 2023, we plan to hold a 'Taylor Swift Eras Party', where all Swifties can attend dressed up as their favourite Taylor Swift era! This event would be very similar to our first event (Midnights Party), where pizza, snacks and drinks were provided, with a playlist of some of Taylor's greatest hits played in the background. This event would be the perfect opportunity for new members to get to know one another, and chat with others who also enjoy Taylor Swift's music.\\n\\nSome smaller-scale events we are planning to hold include a karaoke night, as well as a Taylor Swift documentary viewing night (such as the Reputation Stadium Tour Documentary). Furthermore, we plan to have a Taylor-themed trivia night to put our members to the test, and find out who is the #1 Swiftie! All these events will allow members to get closer to one another, as well as to be involved in a society that involves an artist they all enjoy!","primaryPlatform":"Instagram","primaryPlatformUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/unswifties/","cta":"Other: We're Enchanted to Meet You!","category":"Other: Music","photoURL":"https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cdn.linkupevents.com.au/images/UN%2528SWifties%2529.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/club/[clubName]","query":{"clubName":"UN(SWifties)"},"buildId":"ikymQExRFCBliolr4L5Xg","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]},{"props":{"pageProps":{"clubDetails":{"Account Record Type":"Internal Organizations","Internal Category":"Sport Clubs","Account ID":"0016F0000419wVj","Account Name":"Underwater","Short Name":null,"Description":"The UNSW Underwater Club organises regular weekend shore and boat dives with its own boats, as well as trips away to places like Jervis Bay, South West Rocks, the GBR, and other well-known dives such as the Regent and the Doncaster.","Arc Member Fee":null,"Non Arc Member Fee":null,"Associate Member Fee":null,"New Club":false,"Website":"https://www.revolutionise.com.au/underwaterclub/home/","Club Email":"president@underwaterclub.org","Facebook Page":"https://www.facebook.com/underwaterclub/","Facebook Group":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/underwaterclub","Discord Server Link":null,"Eligible for AHEGS":false,"Keyword Field":[],"Instagram URL":"https://www.instagram.com/unsw_underwater/","Logo URL":"https://cdn.linkupevents.com.au/arc_logo.png","Categories":["Fitness \\u0026 Recreation"]},"clubGuide":null},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/club/[clubName]","query":{"clubName":"Underwater"},"buildId":"ikymQExRFCBliolr4L5Xg","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]},{"props":{"pageProps":{"clubDetails":{"Account Record Type":"Internal Organizations","Internal Category":"Sport Clubs","Account ID":"0016F0000419wVk","Account Name":"Underwater Rugby","Short Name":null,"Description":"Australia's first underwater rugby club.

Although UNIT originally geared towards those interested in investing and trading, we have now expanded to cater to those interested in all aspects of finance. UNIT spreads across six premier Australian universities; The University of Sydney, The University of New South Wales, Macquarie University, University of Melbourne, Monash University and University of Queensland. We strive to provide financial education for novices and experts alike through our educational seminars, promote career opportunities through Facebook, weekly e-Newsletters and our website and provide professional networking opportunities for students spread across a broad range of degrees and majors. Some of our keynote events included the Citi Global Markets Challenge, Industry Insights Evening and Diversity in Finance. Over the years, UNIT has rapidly become one of the most dynamic and enthusiastically supported student bodies on campus, enjoying a strong reputation for energy and professionalism. UNIT has over 11,000 student members. The genuine value offered to members underlies our continual growth and stamps UNIT as the largest finance focused student organisations in Australia. While there are many commerce-themed societies on campus, two key aspects of UNIT's philosophy sets it distinctly apart from the pack: Firstly, UNIT's mission is pure and simple: to provide free education to students interested in trading and investing. UNIT hosts talks and presentations from industry leaders - including hedge funds, boutique funds, brokers, market-making traders and the ASX - that not only introduce students to the fundamentals of investing and trading, but expose students to industry practices not taught inside the classroom and textbook. Secondly, UNIT is student-focused. While useful careers-wise, the education provided by UNIT aims to equip students with the knowledge and confidence to start up and manage their own share portfolios and invest for life. No doubt many students begin university wondering how they too can trade shares and other instruments - UNIT aims to answer that question. As part of our student-focus, we try to cater to as many students as possible. As such UNIT also holds a variety of other events, including our inaugural Stock Pitch Challenge, workshops, coffee with a professional, poker night and round table discussions. We believe this philosophy, coupled with the unbridled enthusiasm and dedication of the UNIT team makes us a valuable contribution to student life on campus.","Arc Member Fee":0,"Non Arc Member Fee":0,"Associate Member Fee":0,"New Club":false,"Website":"www.unit.org.au","Club Email":"unsw@unit.org.au","Facebook Page":"www.facebook.com/UNIT.UNSW","Facebook Group":null,"Discord Server Link":null,"Eligible for AHEGS":true,"Keyword Field":["business","commerce","finance","investing","trading"],"Instagram URL":null,"Logo URL":"https://cdn.linkupevents.com.au/society/unit.unsw.jpg","Categories":["Business \\u0026 Law","Appreciation/Special Interests"]},"clubGuide":null},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/club/[clubName]","query":{"clubName":"University Network for Investing \\u0026 Trading"},"buildId":"ikymQExRFCBliolr4L5Xg","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]},{"props":{"pageProps":{"clubDetails":{"Account Record Type":"Club","Internal Category":null,"Account ID":"0016F000049Tuh1","Account Name":"University of New South Wales - Google Developer Student Club","Short Name":"UNSW GDSC","Description":"Google Developer Student Clubs are university based community groups for students interested in Google developer technologies.
