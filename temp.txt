We invites students to share knowledge, investigate and question the treatment of animals in their everyday life. The power of knowledge and information sharing is liberation and education is the premise of progress and change and nowhere is this more well-place than at a university where knowledge sharing is a fundamental ingredient in its core function. We aim to make a valuable educational contribution to the UNSW staff and student community by creating a forum to actively engage, investigate, debate, hypothesise and ultimately raise awareness with regard to the ethical issues and concerns pertaining to animal welfare.

And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. Matthew 28:19-20 Statement of Faith: As a Chinese Christian fellowship, we are called to be committed to evangelism to the Chinese community at UNSW. We rejoice in our fellowship with brothers and sisters from local churches across Sydney, and pray that God will make us a humble, vigorous, attractive fellowship, bringing the good news especially to those who have never heard of Jesus Christ. In light of our nature as a Christian fellowship with members from different church backgrounds and for the sake of clarity and integrity in all our work and relationships, we humbly declare the following fundamental truths of the Christian faith and mission: 1. We believe in the one, holy, sovereign, creating and redeeming God, eternally existing in three Persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 2. We believe in the divine inspiration and entire trustworthiness of the Bible, its infallible teaching and supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct; and its normative value for all peoples, at all times, in all cultures. We believe that all people without distinction are made in the image of God, but all are now sinners and have incurred both God?s holy wrath and their own shame and guilt. All are therefore in utter need of redemption. 3. We believe in Jesus Christ our Lord, the incarnate Son of God, uniquely God-man and the only Savior. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, sacrificial death, bodily resurrection and ascension. We believe He has achieved the final defeat of Satan and all evil powers. 4. We believe in the justification of sinners by God?s grace, through faith in Christ alone. 5. We believe in the Holy Spirit and His convicting, regenerating, sanctifying and reviving work. He guides and empowers individuals and churches in their service to God and all people. 6. We believe in the unity and priesthood of all believers who together form the one, holy, universal, apostolic church. 7. We believe in the visible, personal return of Jesus Christ in power and great glory to judge both the living and the dead. We believe that the Scriptures set out only two destinies for humanity; the joyful prospect of eternal life in the presence of God for those who have received Christ and the agonizing prospect of eternal separation from God for those who have rejected Him.","Arc Member Fee":null,"Non Arc Member Fee":null,"Associate Member Fee":null,"New Club":false,"Website":null,"Club Email":"unswccf@gmail.com","Facebook Page":"https://www.facebook.com/unsw.ccf","Facebook Group":null,"Discord Server Link":null,"Eligible for AHEGS":false,"Keyword Field":["CCF","Chinese","Christian","Fellowship"],"Instagram URL":null,"Logo URL":"https://cdn.linkupevents.com.au/society/unsw.ccf.jpg","Categories":["Religious/Spiritual"]},"clubGuide":null},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/club/[clubName]","query":{"clubName":"Cantonese Christian Fellowship"},"buildId":"ikymQExRFCBliolr4L5Xg","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]}{"props":{"pageProps":{"clubDetails":{"Account Record Type":"Club","Internal Category":null,"Account ID":"0016F0000371VwZ","Account Name":"Car Society","Short Name":"CarSoc","Description":"To most people, cars are a means of getting from A to B, but to us cars are a passion and a lifestyle.

Do we know our own dynamic potential and the power of our own ability? Do we know how to channel our minds towards achieving great success? Do we know why we sometimes feel so angry, frightened, or sad? Do we know how we can be happy and peaceful at all times? CHYK is a meeting place for young minds seeking a greater awareness and understanding of themselves and the world around them. By questions, reflection, and discussion, we seek to empower ourselves and our lives. The wealth hidden in our religion and culture help us grow beyond our limitations, so that we can face the challenges of life with purpose, confidence, and inspiration. Chyks are not those who are not content to sit back and watch, but we want to make a difference in the world, through right thinking and right actions. Chinmaya Mission is a global spiritual organisation that was founded in 1953 by devotees of Swami Chinmayananda in India.

The core aim of CREATE is to provide opportunities for students to learn practical skills in engineering, innovation and design as well as collaborate on shared ideas and projects. By maintaining an active community of like-minded ?makers? and providing resources, knowledge and technology, the club seeks to foster an environment where anyone, regardless of their background, can be inspired to turn their ideas into designs, prototypes and products. We are firm believers in collective knowledge, learning and cooperation as an effective way to expand what is possible for any individual to accomplish. CREATE runs an array of varying activities to help facilitate this ideal. The team hosts a series of workshops teaching basic technical skills in Arduino electrical interfacing and programming as well as Computer Aided Design (CAD) modelling with digital fabrication. CREATE also fosters team projects including: Project Illuminate making annual entries into the VIVID Sydney Light Festival and participating teams in the Droid Racing Challenge (DRC) hosted by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Lastly, they operate the sales of affordable electrical and robotic components at UNSW during semester, to supply students with the parts they need for projects big or small. CREATE has gained many accomplishments over the years, and strives to continue expanding their community and carry forth the maker movement of UNSW.

DRU adds value through the research and development of human-centered designs based on water supply reliability, water demand reduction, and weather data analysis. The 3 main projects that the DRU team are currently working on include: - Solar-Powered UV-C water purification systems for rainwater tanks. The team is currently working in partnership with UNSW Professors and Gulu University to test different prototypes to achieve the most sustainable and efficient system. Targeted SDG?s = 3. Good Health and Well-being, 6. Clean water and sanitation, - Research into more efficient agricultural and irrigation practices for more successful harvesting. Targeted SGD?s = 1. No Poverty, 2. Zero Hunger, 5. Gender Equality, 12. Responsible Consumption and Production - Weather data analysis - In December 2019, the DRU team travelled to Uganda to install 2 solar-powered weather stations with the aim of analysing rainfall patterns to provide LMF with the opportunity to educate the Ugandan women (breadwinners for their families) on farming with consideration of rain to minimise the impacts of drought and erratic climate patterns.
